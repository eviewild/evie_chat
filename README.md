🌟 Evie Chat — My First Public FiveM Script

Evie Chat is my first publicly released FiveM script, created to provide a modern, immersive alternative to the default chat system.

It features a fully transparent HUD-style chat, supports all server commands, and adds immersive 3D text above players’ heads for roleplay interactions like /me and /do.

Designed to be lightweight, framework-agnostic, and easy to use, Evie Chat focuses on keeping roleplay clean and uninterrupted.
